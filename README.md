This is a simple repo for our current research.<br>
The main purpose of our research is to optimize the FGK-means algorithm by combining genneric method with it.<br>
Here are some control groups which can be used to verify our new method.<br>
We have several benchmarks to check the performance of each method, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rand_index">Rand index</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rand_index">accuracy</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision">precision, recall</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F1_score">f-measure</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_information#Normalized_variants">normalized mutual information(NMI)</a>.<br>
